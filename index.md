## About Me

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Journalism and Media at the University of Texas at Austin. My supervisor is [Dr. Stephen Reese](https://journalism.utexas.edu/faculty/stephen-d-reese) and I GRA for [Dr. Josephine Lukito](https://moody.utexas.edu/faculty/jo-lukito). As of now, I serve as the student lead for the Data and Democracy (D&D) research group and hold the position of graduate research fellow in the Computational Propaganda Vertical of the Center for Media Engagement (CME).

My research interests center on using quantitative, computational, and mixed-methods approaches to study political issues. My ongoing research is focused on multi-platform spread of mis/disinformation and their interplay with news media and platforms. I am also interested in comparative media studies and how different media ecologies may shape news production and public opinion.

## Research Interests

- **Computational Social Science:** large-scale text processing, content analysis, network analysis, frame detection, text classification
- **Political Communication:** political mis/disinformation, digital collective actions, strategic communication
- **Comparative Media Studies:** comparative news framing, public opinion in Global South
