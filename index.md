## About
{: #about}
Hi! I am a Ph.D. candidate in [Journalism and Media](https://journalism.utexas.edu/) at the University of Texas at Austin. My supervisor is [Dr. Stephen Reese](https://journalism.utexas.edu/faculty/stephen-d-reese) and I am a GRA for [Dr. Josephine Lukito](https://moody.utexas.edu/faculty/jo-lukito). As of now, I serve as a Graduate Research Fellow at the [Media and Democracy Data Cooperative](https://mddatacoop.org/) (MDDC) and [Center for Media Engagement](https://mediaengagement.org) (CME). I am currently the student lead for the Data and Democracy (D&D) research group. I also hold an M.S. degree in [Statistics and Data Science](https://stat.utexas.edu/) from the University of Texas at Austin.

My research focuses on the social and political implications of emerging media. My ongoing research takes a multi-platform approach to examining the strategic communication of politicians, activists, and right-wing media organizations.
